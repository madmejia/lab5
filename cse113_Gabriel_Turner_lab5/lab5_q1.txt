Structures are better in situations where multiple variables are needed to be stored about a
specific item. For example, say you need to code information about like a patient or customer or 
something. The information needed might include height, weight, age, previous health issues etc.
Instead of making like 4+ arrays for this and having weird formatting stuff, a structure is perfect
for this as all the information can be stored in a structure with a certain index that corresponds to
that person or customer.

Arrays are better for more data analysis stuff of just one variable. Say you want to store just the
ages of people that are your customers to try and find the average. This would be better suited for 
an array than a structure because there is only 1 variable that is being stored not like multiple
variables or stuff. So basically arrays are just a slightly worse vesion of structures but save time 
if it's just like one element and stuff.
