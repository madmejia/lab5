Structures are much better when dealing with heterogenous data types. This is because they can be used in cases where multiple pieces of information about a specific item need to be stored. For instance, libraries have various books all with their own kinds of data sets. Books have names, authors, dates of publication, etc. Instead of having to create multiple arrays, structures are helpful in storing this information even if they are different data types.

Meanwhile, arrays are good for analysing one variable in particular or homogenous data types. They can save time and space if there is only one particular aspect you are concerned with. Using the previous example, if you're simply looking for books by one specific author, maybe arrays are a simpler option.
