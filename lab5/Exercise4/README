Lab 5

Purpose: To understand how to use structures and enumerate

Conclusions: 


a) What I learned from this lab:

I learned how structures worked and to what extent they are different from arrays. Particularly, I learned how much more versatile they are when storing variables. Unlike arrays, they are able to store multiple different data types and various information of a specific item. I also was able to learn how to enumerate things and the syntax that comes with it.


b) How did pair programming help/hinder the lab:

Pair: We both were able to come to an agreement that structures can be a lot more efficient than arrays. The syntax can also be less confusing when it comes to more complicated programs. For the arrays, we were able to catch each others mistakes.

Buddy: I didn't end up consulting my partner during the lab.


c) Issues and how I fixed them (bug report):

I had trouble trying to understand how to store array values through a function in the first exercise, but by simply skipping it and coming back to it later, I was able to figure it out.

d) Improvements that can be made:
There was an issue with the menu in the zodiac sign exercise that I wish I could fix. The continuous "Unrecognizable value" message repeats along with the menu prompt.
